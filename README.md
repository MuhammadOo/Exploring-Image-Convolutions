# Overview

In this lab, We will explore how convolutions work by creating a basic convolution on a 2D grayscale image. First, we wil load the image by taking the [ascent](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.misc.ascent.html) image from [SciPy](https://scipy.org/). It's a nice, built-in picture with lots of angles and lines.
